# pythonPostgreAndPsycopg
Using psycopg, this project uses SQL to create and manage a database in ElephantSQL server.
This project also uses flask and html to display the results of queries performed on the database.
To run this project, follow this instructions:

"You will need to install the Flask web application framework.
Detailed instructions can be found here - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/
Note that for our purposes, you are likely to be perfectly fine with the simple method of installation
- described here: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/#system-wide-installation
Once you have that, you can start the application:

$ export FLASK_APP=pcs.py
        $ flask run
         * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Browse to the application by entering http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.  

Whenever you make changes to your code, you must stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart it, by executing ‘flask run’."

The instructions above were provided by Professor Scott Frees for Database Design (CMPS 364) class
